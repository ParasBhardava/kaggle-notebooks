What if there was a way to break down daunting tasks, foster intelligent collaboration, and build more robust, adaptable systems? Enter multi-agent systems (MAS) – a paradigm shift that's not just for AI researchers anymore, but a powerful toolkit for every software developer.\n\n### Main Sections:\n\n#### 1. Breaking Down the Monolith: Enhanced Modularity and Scalability\n*   **Decomposition of Complex Problems:** MAS allows developers to break down large, intricate problems into smaller, manageable sub-problems, each handled by an independent agent.

One stormy Tuesday, a particularly vicious wave crashed against the tower, rattling the very foundations. When the spray cleared, Elias saw it – a rolled-up piece of parchment wedged in a crevice near the base.\n\nHe retrieved it, his gnarled fingers clumsy with anticipation. Unfurling the brittle material, he gasped. It wasn't parchment at all, but something impossibly smooth, cool to the touch. And it glowed. A faint, emerald light pulsed from the intricate, swirling lines that formed… a map. Not of any coast Elias knew, but of stars. Stars that seemed to wink and shift before his very eyes.\nCriticAgent > This story has a compelling hook and sets up a fascinating mystery. However, it could benefit from a bit more development in a few areas.\n\nHere are a few actionable suggestions:\n\n1.  **Expand on Elias's reaction and internal thoughts:** While his anticipation is mentioned, we don't get much insight into *what* he's feeling beyond surprise and clumsiness. Is he a superstitious man? Does this discovery spark a long-dormant sense of adventure? Does he feel fear, wonder, or a combination? Delving into his internal monologue would deepen his character and the emotional impact of the discovery.\n2.  **Describe the map's appearance in more detail:** The \"intricate, swirling lines\" and \"winking and shifting stars\" are evocative, but more specific imagery could make the map even more wondrous. Are there celestial bodies that look familiar but are in impossible configurations? Does the emerald light form patterns or symbols? The more concrete the description, the more the reader can visualize this extraordinary object.\n3.  **Hint at the \"why\" or \"how\":** While it's good to maintain mystery, a subtle hint about the map's origin or purpose would add another layer. Did the wave *bring* it, or was it *revealed* by the wave? Is it ancient, alien, or magical? Even a fleeting thought from Elias that questions its existence could propel the narrative forward and pique the reader's curiosity further.\nRefinerAgent > Elias had manned the Saltwick Head lighthouse for thirty years, his life a predictable rhythm of polishing brass and tending the lamp. He was a man of routine, not prone to flights of fancy or superstitious notions; the sea, in his experience, was a force of nature, not a mystical entity. So when a particularly vicious wave crashed against the tower, rattling the very foundations, his first thought was of structural integrity, not omens. But when the spray cleared, Elias saw it – a rolled-up cylinder of something wedged in a crevice near the base, pulsing with an unnatural light.\n\nHe retrieved it, his gnarled fingers clumsy with a mixture of apprehension and a flicker of something he hadn't felt in decades: wonder. This was no ordinary sea-weathered parchment. It was impossibly smooth, cool to the touch, and emanated a faint, emerald luminescence. As he unfurled it, the light intensified, revealing intricate, swirling lines that coalesced into a map. Not of any coastline Elias knew, but of stars.\n\nHis breath hitched. These weren't static celestial bodies; they winked and shifted, constellations rearranging themselves in impossible configurations. Emerald light traced paths between them, forming patterns that Elias felt, deep in his bones, were significant, though he couldn't decipher their meaning. Was this a map to another world? A remnant of something ancient, or perhaps, something alien? The sheer impossibility of it sent a shiver down his spine, a primal fear warring with an unexpected, exhilarating sense of adventure. The wave hadn't just battered his lighthouse; it had delivered a mystery, a cosmic enigma that now pulsed with emerald light in his weathered hands.\nCriticAgent > APPROVED\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stderr","text":"WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts.

Most importantly, you learned how to be the **director** of that team.\n\nYou used `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, and `LoopAgent` to create deterministic workflows, and you even used an LLM as a 'manager' to make dynamic decisions.
