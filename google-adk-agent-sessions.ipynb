The pace of progress is truly remarkable.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to the **Generative AI for Molecule Design** development in drug discovery. This is a truly groundbreaking area, so let's dive deeper!\n\n**What is Generative AI in this Context?**\n\nThink of generative AI models as highly sophisticated digital \"chemists\" or \"artists\" that can learn the underlying rules of molecular structure and chemistry from vast datasets of existing molecules. Once trained, they can then *generate* entirely new molecular structures that have never been seen before, but are designed to possess specific, desirable properties.\n\n**How it Works (Simplified):**\n\n1.  **Training Data:** The AI is fed enormous datasets of chemical compounds. This data includes information about their structure, properties (like solubility, toxicity, how well they bind to a target protein), and how they were synthesized.\n2.  **Learning the Rules:** The AI learns the complex relationships between molecular structure and properties. It understands what makes a molecule \"drug-like,\" what makes it bind to a particular target, and what might make it toxic. It learns the \"grammar\" of chemistry.\n3.  **Generation:** When given a specific objective (e.g., \"design a molecule that binds strongly to protein X and has low toxicity\"), the AI uses its learned knowledge to create new molecular structures that meet these criteria. This is often done by:\n    *   **De Novo Design:** Creating molecules completely from scratch.\n    *   **Scaffold Hopping:** Taking an existing molecule and redesigning its core structure while retaining its key functional parts.\n    *   **Lead Optimization:** Taking a promising but imperfect molecule and suggesting modifications to improve its properties.\n\n**Key Benefits and Advancements:**\n\n*   **Exploring Vast Chemical Space:** The number of possible molecules is astronomical (estimated to be around 10^60). Traditional methods can only explore a tiny fraction of this space. Generative AI allows for a much more directed and efficient exploration of this vast \"chemical universe.\"\n*   **Designing for Specific Properties:** Instead of screening existing libraries and hoping to find something suitable, AI can design molecules *tailor-made* for a specific target and with desired drug-like characteristics from the outset. This includes:\n    *   **High Binding Affinity:** Ensuring the molecule strongly attaches to its intended target protein.\n    *   **Selectivity:** Minimizing binding to unintended targets, which reduces side effects.\n    *   **Good Pharmacokinetics (ADME):** Designing molecules that are well-absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted by the body.\n    *   **Synthesizability:** Some advanced models can even suggest molecules that are likely to be feasible to synthesize in a lab.\n*   **Speed:** The generation of potential drug candidates can be significantly faster than traditional methods, moving from concept to initial molecular design in weeks or months, rather than years.\n*   **Novelty:** Generative AI can come up with entirely new molecular scaffolds and designs that human chemists might not have conceived of, potentially leading to breakthrough therapies.\n\n**Types of Generative AI Models Used:**\n\n*   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** These involve two neural networks (a generator and a discriminator) that compete, leading to increasingly sophisticated molecule generation.\n*   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These models learn a compressed representation of molecules and then use it to generate new ones.\n*   **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Transformers:** These are often used to generate molecules as sequences of characters (like SMILES strings), learning the \"language\" of chemistry.\n*   **Reinforcement Learning (RL):** Often combined with other generative models, RL allows the AI to \"learn by doing,\" optimizing molecule generation based on rewards tied to desired properties.\n\n**Real-World Impact and Examples:**\n\nCompanies are increasingly using generative AI to:\n\n*   **Discover novel drug candidates for challenging targets:** This includes diseases with unmet medical needs where traditional approaches have struggled.\n*   **Optimize existing drug leads:** Making them more effective and safer.\n*   **Design new classes of therapeutics:** Such as protein degraders or novel small molecules with unique mechanisms of action.\n\nFor instance, Insilico Medicine famously used its generative AI platform to discover and design a novel small molecule drug candidate for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and then advance it into clinical trials in a remarkably short timeframe.\n\nThis development signifies a shift from \"finding\" drugs to \"creating\" them, opening up unprecedented possibilities in the fight against disease.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the key players in the exciting field of **Generative AI for Molecule Design** in drug discovery.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
